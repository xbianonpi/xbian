# Configuration for tmpfs filesystems mounted in early boot, before
# filesystems from /etc/fstab are mounted.  For information about
# these variables see the tmpfs(5) manual page.

# /run is always mounted as a tmpfs on systems which support tmpfs
# mounts.

# mount /run/lock as a tmpfs (separately from /run).  Defaults to yes;
# set to no to disable (/run/lock will then be part of the /run tmpfs,
# if available).
RAMLOCK=yes

# mount /run/shm as a tmpfs (separately from /run).  Defaults to yes;
# set to no to disable (/run/shm will then be part of the /run tmpfs,
# if available).
RAMSHM=yes

# mount /tmp as a tmpfs.  Defaults to no; set to yes to enable (/tmp
# will be part of the root filesystem if disabled).  /tmp may also be
# configured to be a separate mount in /etc/fstab.
RAMTMP=no

# Size limits.  Please see tmpfs(5) for details on how to configure
# tmpfs size limits.

# Mount tmpfs on /tmp if there is less than the limit size (in kiB) on
# the root filesystem (overriding RAMTMP).
