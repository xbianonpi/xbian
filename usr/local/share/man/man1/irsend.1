.SH NAME
irsend - basic LIRC program to send infra-red commands
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B irsend
[\fIoptions\fR] \fIDIRECTIVE REMOTE CODE \fR[\fICODE\fR...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Asks the \fBlircd\fR daemon to send one or more CIR
(Consumer Infra-Red) commands. This is intended for remote control
of electronic devices such as TV boxes, HiFi sets, etc.
.PP
\fIDIRECTIVE\fR can be:
.nf
.RS 3
\fBSEND_ONCE\fR         - send \fICODE\fR [\fICODE\fR ...] once
\fBSEND_START\fR        - start repeating \fICODE\fR
\fBSEND_STOP\fR         - stop repeating \fICODE\fR
\fBLIST\fR              - list configured remote items
\fBSET_TRANSMITTERS\fR  - set transmitters \fINUM\fR [\fINUM\fR ...]
\fBSIMULATE\fR          - simulate IR event
.RE
.fi

.PP 
\fIREMOTE\fR is the name of a remote, as described in the \fBlircd\fR
configuration file.

.PP
\fICODE\fR is the name of a remote control key of \fIREMOTE\fR, as it
appears in the \fBlircd\fR configuration file.

.PP
\fINUM\fR is the transmitter number of the hardware device. 

.PP
For the \fBLIST\fR \fIDIRECTIVE\fR, \fIREMOTE\fR and/or \fICODE\fR
can be empty:

.nf
.RS 3
\fBLIST\fR   ""    ""   - list all configured remote names
\fBLIST\fR \fIREMOTE\fR  ""   - list all codes of \fIREMOTE\fR
\fBLIST\fR \fIREMOTE\fR \fICODE\fR  - list only \fICODE\fR of \fIREMOTE\fR
.RE
.fi

.PP
The \fBSIMULATE\fR command only works if it has been explicitly
enabled in lircd.

Default \fBlircd\fR configuration file.  It should contain all the
remotes, their infra-red codes and the corresponding timing and 
waveform details.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
If \fBlircd\fR is not running (or /var/run/lirc/lircd lacks write
permissions) \fBirsend\fR aborts with the following diagnostics:
.nf
"irsend: could not connect to socket"
"irsend: Connection refused" (or "Permission denied").
